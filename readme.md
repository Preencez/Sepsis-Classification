The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly precise and efficient method for categorizing sepsis cases by utilizing the FastAPI framework. Sepsis, a critical medical condition, necessitates swift identification and treatment. Hence, the focus lies on creating a robust system that can accurately detect and classify sepsis cases, enabling healthcare providers to respond promptly and effectively to this life-threatening condition.

Project Overview
The "Sepsis Classification with FastAPI" project focuses on creating an accurate and efficient system for classifying sepsis cases using the FastAPI framework. As sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention, this project addresses the critical need for timely identification and classification of sepsis cases. By achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in sepsis classification, the system aims to improve diagnostic capabilities.

The objectives of the project are as follows:

Train a machine learning model using a diverse dataset of sepsis cases to accurately predict the likelihood of sepsis in patients.

Implement the FastAPI framework to create a user-friendly and efficient web interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the sepsis classification model.

Provide a comprehensive and scalable solution that can be easily deployed in real-time healthcare environments.

Key challenges in this project include obtaining and preprocessing a reliable sepsis dataset, selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, optimizing the model's performance, and ensuring secure and efficient deployment of the system.

Summary
The project's outcomes include the creation of a FastAPI-based application that enables healthcare professionals to predict sepsis occurrence. Additionally, a Streamlit-based application is available for further exploration and analysis of the sepsis dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, various analyses were conducted to gain insights into the sepsis dataset. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed, along with hypothesis testing. The findings provided valuable insights into the relationships between variables and their impact on sepsis classification.

Modeling
The project evaluated several machine learning models, considering the imbalanced nature of the data. The models were assessed using metrics like F1 score and AUC score, providing a balanced evaluation on the imbalanced dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was also performed to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
The evaluation phase considered the imbalanced dataset, utilizing the F1 score as a balanced measure of accuracy and the AUC score to assess the models' ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.a comparison of the models was also done to know the best model to use for classification
